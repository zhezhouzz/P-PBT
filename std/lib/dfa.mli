val minimize : dfa -> dfa
(** [minimize dfa] is a minimized dfa equivalent to the dfa [dfa],
    obtained via Brzozowski's algorithm *)

val accept : dfa -> char list -> bool
(** [accept dfa l] is [true] iff the dfa [dfa] accepts the
    character sequence [l] *)

val determinize : Nfa.nfa -> dfa
(** [determinize nfa] is a deterministic finite automaton that
    accepts the same language as [nfa].

    NB: at present, [determinize] assumes that [nfa] has no Îµ
    transitions, which is the case for automata built by {!Regex.compile}.

val inject : dfa -> Nfa.nfa
(** [inject dfa] is the deterministic NFA corresponding to [dfa] *)
