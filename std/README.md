## re-nfa: convert regular expressions to NFAs

[![Travis build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yallop/ocaml-re-nfa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yallop/ocaml-re-nfa)

This repository provides a library and executable for converting
regular expressions into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) using
[Glushkov's construction][glushkov], for converting NFAs into DFAs
using the [powerset construction][powerset], for minimizing DFAs using
[Brzozowski's algorithm][brzozowski] and for formatting the NFAs using
[DOT][DOT] so that they can be displayed using [graphviz][graphviz].

### Online demo

The easiest way to try the code is to use the [web UI][web-ui] written
by [Joel Jakobsson][joelonsql].

### The `re-nfa` executable

The `re-nfa` executable accepts a single regular expression argument
and prints a [DOT][DOT] graph for the corresponding NFA or DFA to standard
output.  For example, the following command

```
re-nfa "a*b"
```

produces the following output.

```dot
digraph {
  "rankdir" = "LR";
  node [ "shape" = "none";] ""
  node [ "shape" = "circle";] "1"
  node [ "shape" = "doublecircle";] "2"
  node [ "shape" = "circle";] "0"
  "" -> "0" 
  "1" -> "2" [ "label" = "b";]
  "0" -> "2" [ "label" = "b";]
  "1" -> "1" [ "label" = "a";]
  "0" -> "1" [ "label" = "a";]
}
```

To display the corresponding DFA or minimized DFA, pass the `-type` argument:

```
re-nfa -type dfa "a*b"
```

```
re-nfa -type dfa-minimized "a*b"
```

On a Unix system you might pipe the output directly to `dot`, and then
on to [`display`][display], like this:

```bash
re-nfa "a*b" | dot -Tpng | display
```

to display the following graph:

![a*b](/images/astarb.png)

Here is the minimized version:

![a*b](/images/astarb-minimized.png)

Here is a more complex graph constructed from the regex `a?a?a?aaa` that causes pathological backtracking behaviour in some engines, as described in Russ Cox's article [Regular Expression Matching Can Be Simple And Fast][simple-and-fast]:

![a?a?a?aaa](/images/aqaqaqaaa.png)

and here is the corresponding DFA:

![a?a?a?aaa](/images/aqaqaqaaa-dfa.png)

### Library

This repository also provides a library interface.  The [`Regex`][regex] module provides an [`ocaml-re`][ocaml-re]-style combinator interface for constructing regular expressions

```ocaml
seq (star (chr 'a')) (chr 'b')     (* a*b *)
```

as well as functions `parse` and `compile` for building a regular
expression from a string and for turning a regular expression into an
NFA.


```ocaml
val parse : string -> t
val compile : t -> Nfa.nfa
```


The [`Nfa`][nfa] module provides a function for testing whether an NFA
accepts a string (represented as a list of characters):

```ocaml
val accept : Nfa.t -> char list -> bool
```

The [`Nfa_dot`][nfa_dot] module provides functions for converting NFAs
to DOT directed graphs and for pretty-printing the graphs:


```ocaml
val digraph_of_nfa : Nfa.nfa -> digraph
val format_digraph : Format.formatter -> digraph -> unit
```

The [`Dfa`][dfa] module provides functions for converting between NFAs and DFAs,
a DFA minimization function, and and an `accept` function for DFAs

```ocaml
val determinize : Nfa.nfa -> dfa
val inject : dfa -> Nfa.nfa
val minimize : dfa -> dfa
val accept : dfa -> char list -> bool
```


### Rationale

The code in this repository is an extracted and extended portion of
an exercise from a 2018 [advanced functional programming course][afp-exercises].
If you're interested in learning MetaOCaml then you may enjoy
completing the original exercise, perhaps after reading the
[course notes][afp-notes].

Knowing the provenance of the code helps in understanding some of the
choices made.

For example, there are several algorithms for constructing NFAs, but
Glushkov's has a property that turns out to be convenient for the
exercise: it constructs an automaton without Îµ-transitions.

Additionally, the code here is not especially efficient; the remainder
of the original exercise involves using multi-stage programming to
turn the rather inefficient NFA interpreter into a compiler that
produces rather efficient code --- typically more efficient than
production regex engines.  (Similar transformations using
[Scala LMS][lms] are also described in the literature: see
[Optimizing data structures in high-level programs: New directions for extensible compilers based on staging][rompf2013] (Rompf et al. 2013))
